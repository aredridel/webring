The nineties called. They hear you're having an awesome party. Like with
javascripts and everything. They wanted to know if they could just show up or
if we need anything like more guacamole or some animated "Under Construction"
signs.

So you tell 'em they just gotta add their site to this webring, and they can
totally join in. It'll be the smoothest sign-up flow ever. We have this shit
_nailed_. You know how it is. Just put in the URL, we'll totally add you. Just
put that little bit of javasrcipt on your page. Tell us you did and voil√°,
you're in [like Flynn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOzTikUdvuU)
