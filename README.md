The nineties called. They hear you're having an awesome party. Like with
javascripts and everything. They wanted to know if they could just show up or
if we need anything like more guacamole or some animated "Under Construction"
signs.

So you tell 'em they just gotta add their site to this webring, and they can
totally join in. It'll be the smoothest sign-up flow ever. We have this shit
_nailed_. You know how it is. Just put in the URL, we'll totally add you. Just
put that little bit of javasrcipt on your page. Tell us you did and voil√°,
you're in [like Flynn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UYNgUmu35o)

But seriously this is a webring server. It runs the [Retronaut webring](https://webring.dinhe.net). It validates that people actually add
links to the ring. Eventually I or someone will add a function to revalidate
the ring and make sure nobody has removed the links, and set their sites aside
if so. It's meant to stay working, it uses plain json files for its storage. If
anything is as durable as cockroaches it's plain text files.
